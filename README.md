Welcome to Glow Hive!

Created by Bert and Laura.

Here's the corrected version of the text:

Our site is a community-run skin care platform that aims to inform others about the latest skin care products to help them achieve glowing skin. Once you land on the site, you can see all of the products that are offered. You can use our filter to sort the products by type and look for special features such as whether it's vegan, non-toxic, or cruelty-free. Using the search bar, you can also search for a product by type, brand, or name.

Once you land on an individual product page, you will find all the information about the product, including its image, brand, size in ounces, and other product details. At the bottom of the page, you will find logos indicating each of the product's specialty features, and hovering over each logo will provide more information about the logo's meaning. At the bottom of the page, you will also see a home button, as well as an edit and delete button. Users have the option to update the product details if there is a discrepancy or delete the product if it's discontinued or not appropriate for the community.
